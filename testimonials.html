<strong>Asma's Success Story</strong> 
<blockquote>&ldquo;My name is Asma Rashid, currently in Year 9 (nearly 14 years old). I started Tuition Classes on the 20th of November 2004 and I am absolutely over the moon because I am doing so well! I got two merits on Algebraic Equations, five merits on coursework done on the Pythagoras Theorem, A1 in my Maths work and 90% in my last exam just before Christmas. I am definitely benefiting from Tuition Classes!&rdquo;
<br/>
<br/>
All of these achievements in just two months! Dr Kadar is the teacher who has been targeting Asma's weak areas in Maths and hence, she is now reaping the benefits.
  </blockquote>
<strong>Elijah's Success Story</strong>
<blockquote> A mother recently told Tuition Classes about the teacher&rsquo;s excellent comments concerning her 10 year old son.
<br/>
<br/>
Zeb Khan had just started attending the Saturday School and within one month his teacher at his mainstream school told his mother, Mrs Khan, that Zeb had improved tremendously in all his subjects and particularly in his English.<br/>
<br/>
His teacher at Tuition Classes, Ms Ann, has been working extremely hard using brilliant teaching methods in helping all her learners achieve.  </blockquote>
<strong>Aisha&rsquo;s Success Story</strong>
<blockquote>7 year old, Aisha started attending Tuition Classes hoping to do well again in maths.<br/>
<br/>
According to her mother, Mrs Imtiaz, Aisha started off Reception being a star mathematician. However, over the past year, young Aisha was not able to keep up to the usual high standards.<br/>
<br/>
Worried about her daughter's performance Mrs Imtiaz heard about the Saturday School through her daughter's mainstream school and decided to bring Aisha to Tuition Classes. Within a month, Mrs Imtiaz started noticing how confident her 7 year old started becoming in maths again and then her teacher at school also commented that Aisha had reached the top group in maths again.<br/>
<br/>
Both Mrs Imtiaz and Aisha were over the moon and thanked Tuition Classes for the success achieved.</blockquote>
